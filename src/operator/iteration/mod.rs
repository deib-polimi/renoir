/// When the iteration block sends the `FlushAndRestart` message, the state of this host is in a
/// critical state: the iteration block does not update it until it receives the new state from the
/// leader and the downstream operators may access the state of the current iteration.
///
/// When the leader sends the new state we know for sure that all the downstream operators have
/// ended their computation and won't access the state until they receive the first message of the
/// next iteration. When there are shuffles this may lead to problems since the first message a
/// block receives can be from another host that received the state before this host. When this
/// happens the downstream operator will access the old state and this cause undefined behaviour
/// and data-race with the local leader.
///
/// To avoid this race we put in place a lock between iterations: when a block receives a
/// `FlushAndRestart`, before accepting any other message it waits for the local leader to update
/// the local state.
///
/// We cannot simply use a `Mutex<bool>` since it's possible that the state is unlocked, the stream
/// is consumed very quickly and the state is locked immediately after. If this happens fast enough
/// the downstream operators may fail to notice that the state got unlocked, and deadlock the
/// stream.
///
/// To avoid this problem, instead of keeping a _locked_ boolean, we keep the _generation_ of the
/// state: every time an iteration ends the generation is incremented. This allows the downstream
/// operators to know if they _skipped_ an iteration.
///
/// The value of the generation has this meaning:
/// - even value: the state is clean and can be accessed safely
/// - odd value: the state is locked, it cannot be locked again. The state can be accessed safely
///   with a generation lower or equal to this generation.
